description: Where behaviour lives in this repo -- a per-area map of which files and line ranges own what, so you can open the right file instead of searching for it. Use before hunting for where something is implemented, before adding a feature that touches existing behaviour, and when a change seems to need edits in more places than expected.

# Where things live

This repo has two main surfaces (web app and CLI) sharing conversion logic
across seven platform-specific modules. The pages below map each area to its
files.

**Pick the area, open that one page, then go straight to the file.** Do not read
every page -- that defeats the point.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED INDEX -- edit the pages, not this block -->

## Where things live

One page per area of the system. Read before going looking for where
something is implemented.

| page | covers | verified |
|---|---|---|
| [Clipboard I/O](../../../docs/architecture/clipboard-io.md) | how the web app and CLI read and write the system clipboard | 2026-09-16 |
| [Conversion pipeline](../../../docs/architecture/conversion-pipeline.md) | how content is converted between HTML and Markdown, the two directions | 2026-09-16 |

<!-- END GENERATED INDEX -->

The same table, browsable, is [docs/README.md](../../../docs/README.md).

## How to read a line range

Every entry is `file -- lines -- what lives there`. **The line numbers are a
starting point, not an address.** They drift with every commit that touches the
file above them, and nothing regenerates them.

So: jump to roughly that line, then confirm you are in the right place by what the
code says, not by the number. If a range is off by more than a screen or two, fix
it in the page and re-date it -- that is a one-line edit and it is how the map
stays worth having.

Line ranges are given at all because the files that matter most here are big:
`clipboard2markdown.js` is 650 lines and `src/platforms/jira.js` is 300 lines.
"It's in `clipboard2markdown.js`" is not an answer.

## What this map does not tell you

It tells you **where**, not **why it is dangerous**. Several of the areas below
have failure modes that produce no error message. Those are catalogued
separately, by symptom, in the `repo-maintenance` skill and in
[docs/README.md](../../../docs/README.md). If you are about to change clipboard
I/O or pasteboard type handling, look there first.

## Keeping it accurate

A map that lies is worse than none, because it sends people confidently to the
wrong file. Two habits keep it honest:

- **Re-date what you touch.** If you worked in an area and the page was right,
  bump `verified:`. If it was wrong, fix it and bump.
- **Add an area when you create one, not later.** A new subsystem with no page is
  invisible; the next person re-derives its shape from scratch.

To add a page, follow the same rules as any other doc -- see the `repo-maintenance`
skill. Frontmatter for an area page is `title`, `covers` (what someone would be
looking for, phrased as they would phrase it), and `verified`. Then run
`scripts/gen-docs-index.sh`; the block above is generated and hand edits to it
are overwritten.
